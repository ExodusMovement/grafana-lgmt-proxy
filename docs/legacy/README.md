# Legacy Documentation

This directory contains historical planning and development documents that were used during the initial implementation of grafana-lgmt-proxy.

**These documents are preserved for reference but contain outdated information.**

## Why Files Are Here

These documents were moved here because they contain:
- Outdated Grafana Cloud endpoint URLs (e.g., `logs-prod-031` instead of `logs-prod-036`)
- Implementation prompts and phases that are now complete
- Planning details that no longer reflect the current architecture

## Canonical Documentation

For current, accurate documentation, see:
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Main project documentation with correct endpoints, architecture, and usage
